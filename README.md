# Deep learning object detection

A paper list of object detection using deep learning.

- **Hybrid Task Cascade for Instance Segmentation** [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07518)<br>
The Cascade network architecture for instance object detection. It's can fix the drowback of Cascade-RCNN. 
Authors point out parallel processing of cascade-RCNN that prevent effectivery use of box-head and mask-head. They addisonary propose some cascade architecture related to effectivery use of features in backbone and heads.
